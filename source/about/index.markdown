We are the Dinosaur Riding Scrum Jedi Ninja Masters, a team of seniors at the
Ohio State University building an expert system for our computer science
capstone project.

#### The True Story . . .

Long ago, in a time where developing web applications using overly complex
enterprise tools like JBOSS was still considered cool, four champions appeared.
Each ridding an ancient, majestic stead clad in scales.

Practicing futuristic coding techniques these four ninja champions have become
Jedi masters and are the first to ride the dinosaurs since, well, a long time.

Armed with the power of sexy new technologies like Clojure and Heroku the
*Dinosaur Riding Scrum Ninja Jedi Masters* shall ride to victory!
