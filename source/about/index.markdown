We are the Dinosaur Riding Scrum Jedi Ninja Masters, a team of seniors at the
Ohio State University building an expert system for our computer science
capstone project.

#### The True Story . . .

Long ago, in a time where developing web applications using overly complex
enterprise tools like JBOSS was still considered cool, four champions appeared.
Each ridding a majestic, paleolitic steed clad in green scales.

Practicing futuristic coding techniques these four ninja champions have become
Jedi masters and are the first to ride the dinosaurs since, well, a long time.

Armed with the power of sexy new technologies like Clojure and Heroku the
*Dinosaur Riding Scrum Ninja Jedi Masters* shall ride to victory!
