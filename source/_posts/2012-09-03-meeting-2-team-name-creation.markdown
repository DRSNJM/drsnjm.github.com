### Creating a Team Name

Finding the concept of overly zealous agile and scrum teams rather hilarious the
name *Scrum Ninjas* was suggested. However, we were worried that it might be a
name that an overly zealous agile and/or scrum team might actual use.  Not
wanting to be confused with people who actually think a name like *Scrum Ninjas*
is clever we decided alterations were necessary.

Accordingly, we made the name more ridiculous by appending *Jedi Masters* and
finally prepending *Dinosaur Riding*.

## Results

During this meeting we decided that topic 1 did not sounds as interesting or fun
as 2 or 13.  Thus, we adjourned with the intention of picking one or the other
during our next meeting.

We picked the team name: *Dinosaur Riding Scrum Ninja Jedi Masters* (DRSNJM).
