During our meetings one of our favorite topics has been a boardgame
recommendation system. Ratings and recommendations are becoming more common
across the web. However, most of these are rather poor. We believe that AI will
make these better. We are not the first to think so (consider Netflix).

## 1. The Problem

Consider the typical process for deciding what boardgame to play. You and
several friends are looking at a large shelf of games.  Everyone has different
tastes, but in general your groups is looking for the same thing. If you are
fortunate enough to have an experienced boardgamer with you he or she may be
able to make a good recommendation based on his or her internal catalog of
boardgames.  This internal catalog has related information like, genre, type,
speed and difficulty level.  Your expert friend makes a recommendation and
everyone is happy, hopefully.

Unfortunately, even experts can make mistakes. A single expert might not have
all the knowledge necessary to make a good recommendation.
