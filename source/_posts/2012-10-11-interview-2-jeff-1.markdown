## Notes

As with most of our experts we asked Jeff a few basic questions:

1.  How do you pick what game to play?
2.  How do you determine what game to suggest to another player?
3.  What attributes do you think are important to consider when selecting a game
    to play?

#### 1.  Choosing for Self

Jeff selects games to play far in advance and has a rotation set up with fellow
players. Thus he always knows what he is going to play.  Foremost Jeff considers
those he is playing with when selecting games in this fashion.

Here are some attributes Jeff specifically mention he though of:

*   Mental or Fun? -- Does the game require a lot of thinking or is it simpler
    than that.
*   Hard or Easy (i.e. weight)
*   Complexity

#### 2.  Suggesting to Others

Jeff always asks leading questions before making a suggestion. He takes into
account the likes and dislikes of the other player.  He plays special attention
to theme.  He also strongly regrades exclusions made by other players.  If some
one hates games published by Fantasy Flight, then Jeff certainly will not
suggest one that was.

Jeff also suggested that we put default to placing simpler games before more
complex ones since that's what most new players would prefer.

#### 3.  Attributes

(Besides those listed in 1)

*   Play time
*   Gauge skill by the hardest game the client has ever played.
*   Difficulty to learn will correlate highly with number of metrics.
*   Publishers typically produce games for audience at a certain skill level so
    they can be mapped to difficulty to learn.
