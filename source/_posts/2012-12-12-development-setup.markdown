Setting up this board ultimatum for development is not a complicated task, but
it has several dependencies. Most notably, you will need to install a
project and dependency management tool for Clojure called leiningen.
Installation and usage instructions for leiningen can be found on [its github
page](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen).

You can get a [zip of our current source
code](https://github.com/DRSNJM/board-ultimatum/archive/master.zip) but we
suggest using [git](http://git-scm.com/) which can be downloaded
[here](http://git-scm.com/downloads).

Once you have leiningen setup the [instructions on our github
repository](https://github.com/DRSNJM/board-ultimatum) should suffice. Further
dependencies exist if you want to modify or use styles. [Instructions for doing
this](https://github.com/DRSNJM/board-ultimatum#modifying-styles) are also
available on the projects README.
