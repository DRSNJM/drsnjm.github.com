## Goals

Assess the requirements and difficulty of the most popular potential projects.

## Discussion

As previously determined, the AI Search and Board Ultimatum projects were the most popular among groupmembers. David was especially interested in the AI Search project. Alex was less interested in the AI Search project. Chris pointed out that working with existing code may be less desirable than choosing our own methods. Alex liked the board game recommendation project because it would be useful and interesting, and as a member of a board game group, he believes that the system would be actually used. Chris suggested that the board game project would better resemble previous projects provided by the instructor, and, as such, would be safer, while still interesting. Alex pointed out that he knows many serious board game players through the club, so the team would have easy access to experts in the area.

The "Reading Leveler" (a reading level classification engine), proposed by Ryan, was also popular among group members. The team would have access to some experts, potentially professors and elementary school teachers. David and Ryan suggested that the engine would likely involve some type of semantic processing engine, and Chris points out that this may make the project unnecessarily complex for the scope of the capstone project.

## Results

Everyone gained a better understanding of the general requirements of each of these popular proposals, but none were definitively selected.
