## Worklog

### Chris Powers

*   Created the [attribute scoring engine](https://github.com/DRSNJM/board-ultimatum/blob/attr-search/src/board_ultimatum/attr_engine.clj)
*   Implemented [filtering on the number of players](https://github.com/DRSNJM/board-ultimatum/blob/attr-search/src/board_ultimatum/engine/model.clj)
*   Added results page sorting by score.
*   Hooked up front-end with filtering and scoring components to ensure queries now work (takes user input, pulls data, filters, scores, presents, in that order)
