## Goals

Get all necessary content for the first team deliverable on the website

## Discussion

All four members talked about the requirements of the deliverable. Chris had errors deploying the website, and David had errors previewing. Both of them noticed css errors on the website, which David wrote a fix for. Ryan brought up pressing matters of online music streaming services. Alex got clarification on his proposal expectations. Ryan figured out how to make the site prettier. David drew a striking likeness of a Dinosaur Riding Scrum Ninja Jedi Master for use on the site.

## Results

Alex and David finished their project proposals. Everyone added their bios. Chris and Ryan uploaded all meeting notes to date, and added other pages and posts to the website. In particular, a front page for the website was added that introduces visitors to website and project.
