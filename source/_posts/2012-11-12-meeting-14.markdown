## Goals

*   Determine how to include simple stats and neural network results.

## Discussion

Despite not having good results from the neural network thus far, replacing our
network output data with the simple statistics data was undesirable. We are
somewhat hopeful that the neural network will perform, but since the simple
statistics shows good results we want the user to use it if they want.

## Results

On the results page and the similar search page there are toggle buttons that
allow the similarity provider to be selected.

## Outgoing Responsibilities

*   Create UI for provider selection --- *Ryan*
*   Train and push output data for both collections --- *David*
