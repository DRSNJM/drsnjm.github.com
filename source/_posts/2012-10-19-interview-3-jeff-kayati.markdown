## Notes

As with most of our experts we asked Jeff a few basic questions:

1.  How do you pick what game to play?
2.  How do you determine what game to suggest to another player?
3.  What attributes do you think are important to consider when selecting a game
    to play?

#### 1.  Choosing for Self

#### 2.  Suggesting to Others

#### 3.  Attributes
