## Notes

Beyond reiterating significant attributes we've heard from previous experts Jeff
also suggested that the user be able to specify whether or not they want to
learn a new game or not. Although we are not tracking user plays we could return
more varied results in this case.

Jeff also suggested that we allow the user to access the similarity engine
directly.  That is, a user can query for a game with specific attributes or he
or she can enter another game they like and get a recommendation from that.

Since the published playtime of a game is often far shorter than actual plays to
new board game players Jeff suggested adjusting playtime based on player skill
level.

Similar to Jeff Horger's suggestion that we filter by publisher, Kayati also
suggested we allow filtering on designer. Also like Jeff Horger, Kayati though
allowing the user to exclude certain attributes is very important.
