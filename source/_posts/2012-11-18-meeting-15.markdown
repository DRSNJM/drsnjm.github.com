## Goals

*   Finish up attribute scoring weights

## Discussion

Alex was almost finished adding all weights for current attributes. Alex wanted
to add a separate page for setting mechanics and category weights.

Alex requested that Chris add scoring and explanations on the weight attribute.
Ideally, the all games would be scored on their weight, so a closeness fit
function needs to be used to score the real valued differences between weights.

## Results

Chris successfully added a scoring function as hoped for weights.

Alex added a page where users can modify the tag weightings and modify the
explanation for any tag. The negative and positive tag weightings can be
independently modified.

*   Add full explanations to different weight scores --- *Chris*
*   Populate tag weights and explanations --- *Alex*
