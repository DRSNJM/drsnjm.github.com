## Problem Domain ##

Board games have been around for thousands of years and are enjoyed by
countless people. The different types of games are innumerable - from something
as simple as checkers to as complex as an advanced role playing game. These
games possess many qualities and attributes, including, but not limited to,
number of players, complexity, age group, mechanics, and player skill level.
With such a diverse set of criteria to describe games, as well as the large
number of games available, one can see how it would be difficult to classify
and recommend games to players that they will enjoy. Whether it is based on a
set of attributes that the player desires, or the player's history of games
thatthey have enjoyed playing in the past, it would be very beneficial to board
game enthusiasts to have access to a system that could provide such
recommendations. 

### Knowledge Base ###

Expert knowledge in the problem domain of board game recommendation can come
from a variety of sources. Human experts primarily include those who design
board games and serious board game enthusiasts, however, in order to be
comprehensive, the opinions and experiences of casual players should also be
considered. The logical rules and decisions that these experts make in choosing
which games to play will play a large part in a system designed to solve this
particular problem. 

Soruces of facts and data in regards to the problem domain can also come from
non-human sources such as [BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com). This
specific website contains a large, publicly accessible database of games,
descriptions, and ratings. This data can be incorporated, as facts or
otherwise, into a system to provide recommendations to its users. 

## Project Motivation ##

One of the team's members, Alex Burkhart, is actively involved in the Columbus
Area Boardgaming Society. He had mentioned that with such a large library (over
1000 games), it would be very beneficial if some sort of application existed to
recommend board games to prospective players. While resources such as
BoardGameGeek exist, there is not a user-friendly interface available to filter
and evaluate the data available to generate relevant recommendations to its
users. The team decided that this problem offered a challenging, flexible, and
extensible project opportunity, and would also provide a complementary service
that would be frequently used and appreciated.
