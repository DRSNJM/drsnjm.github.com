A recording of the interview is accessible
[here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1378350/cse5914/corey-1.3gp).

## Notes

For the most part, Corey reiterated a lot of the things we have heard from
interviews with other experts.  The attributes he suggested are:

*   Mechanics
*   Easy to Learn?
*   Gateway Game?
*   Rank (from BGG)
*   Play time
*   Age Group
*   Availability -- How easy is it to buy this game in a store?

Corey agreed that player skill might also be important and thought that using
most difficult game played might work as well as the number of unique games
played.
