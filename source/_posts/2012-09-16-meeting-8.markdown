## Goals

Determine who is responsible for which tasks in Timebox #2. Bring
David up to speed from the previous meeting. Arrange the first
expert interview.

## Discussion

Several minor bookkeeping issues were discussed in regards to the
github and pivotal tracker accounts. Utilizing tracker to log our
team and individual progress was emphasized, and the procedures
for doing so were decided on. An interview time was arranged with 
our first expert, Ray Chandler, from the Columbus Area Board Game 
Society. A location and time were determined. 

## Results

The tracker was updated to include more detailed descriptions of the 
tasks due for Timebox #2. Ryan, Chris, and Alex are going to meet
with Ray this evening for an interview. David is going to get
started on the powerpoint presentation for the Tuesday status update.
All members are going to complete any tasks assigned to them in the
tracker: [https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/630615](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/630615)
