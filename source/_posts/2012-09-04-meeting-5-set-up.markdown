## Goals

* 	Get everyone on the team set up to add content to the website and push to github
* 	Divide work for first team deliverable
*	Start adding content to meet first team deliverable

## Discussion

Alex helped David setup Ruby and other tools so that he could work on the website. Chris and Ryan already had setup the tools properly, so they began adding categories to the site and adding posts and pages.

## Results

No major decisions were made, everyone just made sure that they were unblocked from contributing content. It was decided that David and Alex would each write up a project proposal, and Chris and Ryan would continue adding site content.

-   Ryan McGowan
