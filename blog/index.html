  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Data Conversion and Analysis</h2>

<p>The first task that I took on during this timebox was converting the data from the board game database into numerical vectors representing each game. The source code for this script can be found <a href="https://github.com/DRSNJM/board-ultimatum/blob/nnet/src/board_ultimatum/engine/vector-convert.clj">here</a>. There are many categories and mechanics included in this vector - its value is 1.0 if the game contains that tag and 0.0 if it does not.</p>

<p>As you can tell by examining the code, the resulting vector has 100+ dimensions. For the sake of performance, I decided that this raw input was impractical for a neural net application. To solve this problem, I turned to PCA (Principal Component Analysis). PCA uses orthagonal transforms to maximize the variability of the data. By projecting my set of 1000 100+ dimensional vectors onto the first 10 principal components, I was able to reduce the dimensionality of the vectors down to ten components. The following is a graph of the data on the first two principal components.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XEnty.png" alt="PC Analysis" /></p>

<p>It is worthwhile to note that the outliers in the bottom right are party games that can accomodate 50+ people and are fairly unique in that regard.</p>

<p>Once the data is converted, it is stored in the Mongo database.</p>

<p>The library I used to perform this analysis is <a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a> which contains much of the functionality found in R, if you are familiar with stats packages.</p>

<h2>Neural Net and Engine output</h2>

<p>The next step was to run the data through the neural net. Since the expert interface is not accessible to public users at this point, an untrained network is used. The network I used is arbitrary at this point as far as hidden layers and propogation algorithms are concerned, since there is no training data. I ran each combination of games through the network with the input as the following: [GameA Game B]. The results were then stored in another Mongo collection.</p>

<p>One problem that I encountered was the amount of storage that the output takes. This problem was mitigated by only storing the 50 games with the best score for each game, reducing the size by a factor of 20. All 1000 values would be calculated, then trimmed down. This would ensure that the database would never have more than ~50000 records, versus 1000000.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="/blog/2012/09/17/preferences-and-constraints/">a previous post</a>, I
discussed the differences between filtering on constraints and scoring on
preferences. As of the last timebox, filtering on game length was implemented
(that is, using the interface, a user could return games of only certain
lengths). For this timebox, I completed the filtering step on the only other
constraint that needs to be filtered on, the number of players.</p>

<p>That is the easy part. Scoring games can get very tricky. At the highest
level, it&#8217;s very intuitive; you simply compare the user preferences to the
game attributes and sum up scores for each match. The most pertinent question
is, what will the numerical score values be based on? Will they be
normalized? To answer the question of normalization, there is no need to
normalize the scores for each match. The only place the scores will be used
is in the ordering of the games presented to the user. In other words, the
scores only need be relative.</p>

<p>What defines a match? If we only considered matches as the user&#8217;s preference
being exactly the same as the game&#8217;s attribute, and all else won&#8217;t earn you
any score, then our job as programmers would be fairly easy. However, the
fact of that matter is that many games may have <em>partial</em> matches; they match
to some degree. For example, if a user indicates that they prefer a light
game, we may want to give some &#8220;full&#8221; score to all light games, but maybe 75%
of the points if the game is medium light, 45% if medium, and 10% if medium
heavy. Unforunately, this implies that the scoring functions need to be
written for each attribute individually, as the degree to which an attribute
matches a preference is dependant upon the attribute.</p>

<p>The final question is, where do we get the scores? This brings us back to the
original goal of this project: to emulate an expert in the field of board
game recommendations. We don&#8217;t need to come up with the scores ourselves; we
need to get experts to tell use what the scores on the attributes ought to be.
 In the future, this will be important information to extract from our experts.</p>

<p>The last thing to consider is that we will be adding explanations on scores
for display on the results page. This means that as each match is made, a
corresponding string must be written or generated that describes what was
matched and how much it affected the score. We can simply maintain a running
list of explanations alongside the score to pass back from the game engine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My reponsibilities for Timebox #3 have primarily revolved around the machine learning extension to our project. After the expert interviews and discussion with potential users that took place during this timebox, it was decided that a search that provides recommended games based on some individual game that a user had enjoyed playing would be very useful and should be surfaced as a main feaure of the application, giving greater weight to this portion of the project. Elaborating on my <a href="/blog/2012/09/21/similarity-engine/">previous post on the topic</a>, I will be discussing some of the design and implementation decisions we have made.</p>

<h2>Creating a Training Set</h2>

<p>One of the challenges of developing a machine learning system, in our case, is having a reliable and sufficiently large training set to use to train the machine implementations we decide to use. This responsibility will fall on our experts and other experienced members of CABS. The number of games in our current input space is currently at 1000, and may be expanded in the future. Since his experts have to be able to rate games in terms of each other, we decided that an interface that randomly selects a set of ~16 games, and then asks which of those games the user is familiar with, would result in much more efficient training. These selections would then be passed to the game comparison screen, described previously, in which the users selects on a sliding scale how much they would recommend the second game based on someone enjoying the first.</p>

<p>Some of the issues that arise from this system include the potential for multiple experts to rate the same pair of games. It is because of this, and also the fact that we dont want experts to be presented the same game pair more than once, that it is necessary to keep track of which training patterns belong to which expert. When it comes time to actually train the system, any duplicates will be averaged together to create the final training set.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>Another step in implementing the system is to produce a set of input data that can be fed through the network. Currently, a record for a single game in the database looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "_id" : ObjectId("507ddc8538ef1f102b000001"),
  "bgg_id" : 12002,
  "name" : "Jambo",
  "thumbnail" : "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1244694_t.jpg",
  "image" : "http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1244694.jpg",
  "min_players" : 2,
  "max_players" : 2,
  "min_age" : 12,
  "length" : 45,
  "year_published" : 2004,
  "rating_average" : 7.13898,
  "rating_bayes_average" : 7.01279,
  "rating_std_dev" : 1.19381,
  "rating_median" : 0,
  "weight_average" : 2.0779,
  "weight_num" : 693,
  "rank" : 233,
  "tags" : [
    {
      "bgg_id" : 1002,
      "subtype" : "category",
      "value" : "Card Game"
    }

    ...

  },
  "suggested_age" : {
    "2" : 0,
    "3" : 0,
    "4" : 0,
    "5" : 0,
    "6" : 1,
    "8" : 2,
    "10" : 14,
    "12" : 8,
    "14" : 2,
    "16" : 0,
    "18" : 0,
    "21 and up" : 0
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, in order to appropriate input for a machine learning implementation, the input must be a vector of numerical values, so I have begun to write a map function to perform this conversion, which can be seen <a href="https://github.com/DRSNJM/board-ultimatum/blob/nnet/src/board_ultimatum/engine/vector-convert.clj">here</a>. The output for the game then looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>[0.0075 0.25 0.25 0.6666666666666666 0.233 0.3465]
</code></pre>

<p>One interesting issue with our set of data is the possibility of having a very large input vector. Ryan and I have discussed this issue and have been researching techniques such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal component analysis</a>, among others, as a possible solution to reduce the number of dimensions of our input. The primary concern is training performance, however, I have not yet had the chance to do any sort of dummy training to get an idea of what the limitations are going to be.</p>

<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

<p>Initially we had discussed using <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a> as our machine learning library, however, after looking into the documentation, it seemed that the neural nets and other features were primarily geared towards being used as classifiers. The domain for our problem falls more into function approximation, as we want to be able to return and train with values in a continuous range, rather than a discrete one.</p>

<p>After looking at my options, I decided to go with <a href="http://www.heatonresearch.com/encog">Encog</a>. Encog has a repuation for being mature and rather optimized in terms of performance. It also has a well-documented Clojure wrapper, <a href="https://github.com/jimpil/enclog">Enclog</a>. Encog offers a variety of network types as well as training algorithms that I will need to experiment with to determine what approach is most appropriate for our input data.</p>

<h2>Returning the Results</h2>

<p>In order to quickly return the values generated by the network, we went ahead and set up a <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> instance that is hooked to our Heroku account. We will be using the <a href="http://redis.io/commands#sorted_set">sorted sets</a> data structure to hold the results. The sorted set in redis takes input in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>key score member
</code></pre>

<p>In our situation, the data we will be inputting will look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>GameID-A similiarty-value GameID-B
</code></pre>

<p>This way, we will be able to very efficiently query what games, given some game A, have a similarity-value in a certain range. The <a href="http://redis.io/commands/zrevrange">zrevrange function</a> will most likely be the most appropriate for making these queries. Once the Game ID&#8217;s have been retrieved, the normal game database can then be queried to provide full details on each game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The most fundamental aspects of the query interface have been implemented.
Though there may be more attributes added in the future, we decided to add a
select few attributes that we believed encapsulated differing types of input we
receive from the user. In particular, we expect the user to select discrete
values for some attributes, such as number of players and time to play (in
discrete intervals), and tri-state objects that can encapsulate the user liking,
disliking, or not caring about a particular attribute. Prototypes were built to
represent these input types, and are currently present on the interface:</p>

<p>These input types maintain hidden values in the background in order to formally
send them to the server.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The most significant interface to our system is by far the query-construction
interface. This is the first page that comes up when a user lands on the
engine&#8217;s webpage, and it encapsulates the core functionality of the system: to
take in user specified attributes and provide back a list of matching results.</p>

<p>The interface is a bit tricky in a few significant ways. Firstly, there are
potentially tens of attributes of games that we could surface as options.
Fortunately, we have our experts to narrow down these attributes to the relevant
ones. Secondly, each attribute has a different domain of values that are
permissible. There&#8217;s no way around this one; we&#8217;ll have to build input selectors
that match for each attribute. Thirdly, even with the reduced list of
attributes, the user will still likely only care about a subset of them. We&#8217;d
prefer if the user only had to interact with those attributes that he considers
relevant to what he&#8217;s looking for.</p>

<p>This last issue brings us to the design of the interface. After some thought, I
proposed to the team two layouts for constructing queries:</p>

<p><img src="/images/diagrams/attr-selection-interface.jpeg" alt="Attribute selection" /></p>

<p>The user selects attributes to the left, then chooses the particular desired or
undesired values of those attributes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/diagrams/accordian-selection.jpeg" alt="Accordian selection" /></p>

<p>The user selects the attributes in the middle, then the area for manipulating
value preferences of those attributes appears under the attribute (sliding out
like an accordian).</p>

<p>The two styles are designed around the notion that users shouldn&#8217;t have to
interact with attributes that they don&#8217;t care about. In both interfaces, the
user only selects attributes that they have a preference on. It&#8217;s important to
note that we intent to take into account negative preferences as well, a
decision made based on feedback from our experts.</p>

<p>After proposing the two designs to the team, it was decided that we would go
with the first design, because we believed that it looked better and utilized
the space better.</p>
