  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the context our project, we would like to extend our project to not only
provide games directly based on a user’s preferences, but also further recommend
games that are similar to the ones provided by our rule-based system. However, a
challenge arises when we try to define the term “similar.” How do we know that a
user will like a game that is similar in attributes to another? What makes
certain types of games desirable if a user liked one particular game? To
alleviate this problem, we decided that utilizing some sort of clustering,
categorization, or machine learning technique would be beneficial.</p>

<p>To start with the most basic of techniques, first we need to numerically
represent our knowledge base. This would need to be in the format of a vector:</p>

<pre><code>&lt; a1, a2, a3, a4 … an &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Where an is the numerical representation of some attribute of the game. For
example, a1 may be the minimum number of players and a3 may be the number of
minutes a game typically takes to play. One metric of game similarity would be
the euclidean distance between the two vectors.</p>

<p>Minimizing distance would yield the two games that are most numerically similar
to each other. To query such a system quickly, a data structure such as an
octree or k-d tree could be used. It is also worthwhile to note that since each
an would cover a different domain, it would be necessary to normalize each
domain to a range of values such as (0.0, 1.0). Otherwise, attributes
represented with large numeric domains would have a greater impact on the
euclidean distance. This issues leads us into our next line of thought,
weighting different attributes by their importance to the user.</p>

<p>One way of introducing importance into this equation is to add an additional
constant to each  attribute of the game, in this case cn, where cn is some value
in the range (0.0, 1.0).</p>

<pre><code>&lt; c1*a1, c2*a2, c3*a3, c4*a4 … cn*an &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>A cn value of 0 represents the least importance, as it makes the nth attribute
have a value of 0 for all vectors. Conversely, a value of 1 represents the
greatest importance to the user, as it allows that attribute to have the largest
impact on the resulting distance.</p>

<p>An alternative method of achieving an “importance” when comparing attribute
values is with gaussian curves. In this case, with the curve centered at μ = an,
some value would be chosen (for example .75) and all values where curve is
greater than .75 for each an would be accepted as “similar.” To introduce the
idea of importance, σ can be changed for each n. A low σ results in a very
narrow curve, and thusly a very narrow range of “similar” values in that axis,
representing high importance, whereas a large σ results in a very wide range of
values, representing a low importance.</p>

<p>In order for this method to work as intended, the curve would have to be scaled
by a factor of σ such that the peak was always at a value of 1.0.</p>

<p>This method could also potentially be used for determining the “similarity”
space for a set of multiple vectors (such as a user’s previously enjoyed games),
but more on that later.</p>

<p>While these methods may be very effective for finding games that are very
similar in terms of their attributes, however, much of what users desire
involves variety in games. If the only recommendations made are games that are
nearly identical, will the user benefit? Also, are there intangible factors that
make games recommendable in relation to other games that are hard to represent
numerically or via a set of rules? One solution to this issue is to use a
machine learning system.</p>

<p>With a machine learning system, the experts themselves can train the system to
identify games that would be appropriate for recommendation. The hope being that
with enough input, the system itself will produce results similar to that of an
expert. This may be accomplished through, for example, a neural network. First,
the expert would be given an interface that would randomly, or at the choosing
of the expert, provide two games; let’s call them Game A and Game B. The expert
would choose, via some sort of slider UI element a value, with “Would never
recommend” on one end of the spectrum and “Would highly recommend” on the other.
This would be in reference to if the user enjoyed Game A considerably, the
expert would “highly recommend” Game B to that user. The input pattern to the
neural network would be the union of the two games’ attributes, such as the
following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt; a1, a2, a3, a4 … an, b1, b2, b3, b4 … bn &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The network would then be trained with the output being a single floating point
value, with 0 corresponding to “never recommend” and 1.0 corresponding to
“highly recommend.” Once a sufficient amount of training data had been provided,
the system should hypothetically be able to return a confidence factor, provided
with two games, of whether if the user enjoyed the first, they would also enjoy
the second.</p>

<p>The problem with this method lies in the performance of the system. If a certain
number of recommendations are to be made, it would be preferable that those
recommendations have the highest output from the neural network. This means that
in order to arbitrarily find the best match, the entire dataset has to be fed
through the network. If a large dataset exists, this will be very inefficient. A
possible solution to this problem is to have a process running in the
background, updating a sorted set of values for each vector with the output of
the network using some sort of a caching system such as Memcached or Redis for
storage. This way, the best results can be pulled quickly from the cache.</p>

<p>It would be necessary to also keep a database of the experts’ training data.
This way, the network can be trained over as many epochs as necessary. This
would also allow for different networks to be tested and trained with various
architectural choices such as varying numbers of layers and learning rates. The
training data could also be used for some other type of machine learning device,
such as a Support Vector Machine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Problem Domain</h2>

<p>Board games have been around for thousands of years and are enjoyed by
countless people. The different types of games are innumerable - from something
as simple as checkers to as complex as an advanced role playing game. These
games possess many qualities and attributes, including, but not limited to,
number of players, complexity, age group, mechanics, and player skill level.
With such a diverse set of criteria to describe games, as well as the large
number of games available, one can see how it would be difficult to classify
and recommend games to players that they will enjoy. Whether it is based on a
set of attributes that the player desires, or the player&#8217;s history of games
that they have enjoyed playing in the past, it would be very beneficial to board
game enthusiasts to have access to a system that could provide such
recommendations.</p>

<h3>Knowledge Base</h3>

<p>Expert knowledge in the problem domain of board game recommendation can come
from a variety of sources. Human experts primarily include those who design
board games and serious board game enthusiasts, however, in order to be
comprehensive, the opinions and experiences of casual players should also be
considered. The logical rules and decisions that these experts make in choosing
which games to play will play a large part in a system designed to solve this
particular problem.</p>

<p>Soruces of facts and data in regards to the problem domain can also come from
non-human sources such as <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com">BoardGameGeek</a>. This
specific website contains a large, publicly accessible database of games,
descriptions, and ratings. This data can be incorporated, as facts or
otherwise, into a system to provide recommendations to its users.</p>

<h2>Project Motivation</h2>

<p>One of the team&#8217;s members, Alex Burkhart, is actively involved in the Columbus
Area Boardgaming Society. He had mentioned that with such a large library (over
1000 games), it would be very beneficial if some sort of application existed to
recommend board games to prospective players. While resources such as
BoardGameGeek exist, there is not a user-friendly interface available to filter
and evaluate the data available to generate relevant recommendations to its
users. The team decided that this problem offered a challenging, flexible, and
extensible project opportunity, and would also provide a complementary service
that would be frequently used and appreciated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The types of input that the user will be providing through the webpage
interface can be broken down into two categories: preferences and constraints.
Preferences match the user&#8217;s desired characterics of a game, whereas
constraints match rigid conditions of the game.</p>

<p>Preferences include things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mechanics</li>
<li>Systems</li>
<li>Themes</li>
<li>Turn system</li>
<li>Skill vs. luck base</li>
<li>Cooperative vs. competative</li>
</ul>


<p>Constraints include things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of players</li>
<li>Time to play</li>
</ul>


<p>In fact, that constraints list may be comprehensive.</p>

<p>Constraints are easy; there&#8217;s no such thing as a mostly matched constraint.
All they need is a straightforward filter. Simply remove games that don&#8217;t
match these constraints from consideration. There&#8217;s potential for efficiency
increase if filtering is done properly before the recommendation engine parses
the preferences. Preferences, on the other hand, are accurate to some degree,
rather than being a boolean match. We may display a game that matches <em>most</em>
of the mechanics, or is <em>close enough</em> to the user&#8217;s skill vs. luck base,
even though it wasn&#8217;t exactly what they were searching for.</p>

<p>The other significant aspect of preferences is that they can (and should)
incorporate some weighting system on the inputs. A user may not care what
the themes of the game are, and they may only partially care what the turn
system is like. A true expert could take such things into consideration, and,
therefore, so should our expert system.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> This post deals with content discussed in <a href="/blog/2012/09/11/interview-1-raymond-chandler/">the first
 interview</a> with Raymond
 Chandler.</p>

<p> Ray offered insight into the design behind board games with his expertise.
 This isn&#8217;t the same type of expertise we intend to model with the board game
 recommendation engine (we&#8217;re not building an engine that creates board games,
 just one that <em>recommends</em> them for play), but in some respects, it&#8217;s still
 relevant to our problem domain. (It&#8217;s also important to note that Ray is an
 a zealous board game player, and so he is still a highly useful expert.)</p>

<p> The interview writeup goes into greater detail on his explanations of board
 game design, but he gave some good possible game attributes and other input
 that we hadn&#8217;t considered, such as the &#8220;ramp&#8221; and &#8220;tempo&#8221; of a game, and the
 average player skill of those in the group. We discussed the possibility of a
 &#8221;<a href="/blog/2012/09/11/variety-in-recommendation-queries/">similar games engine</a>&#8221;
 to add variety to search results with Ray. Ray didn&#8217;t like the idea of
 directly linking games, as it was demanding on experts and poorly scalable.
 He recommended as an alternative that we link attributes across games so that
 newly added games would be immediately integrated in the system.</p>

<p> While what he recommended made sense, the notion of linking arbitrary
 attributes is rather complex. An example of his proposal is to link
 dice-rolling to card-playing systems as similar. When a new card-playing game
 is added, no new links will need to be established; the engine will know that
 the games are similar because of this link. If all we&#8217;re to do is link
 gameplay mechanics, then that is a reasonable approach. However, it may be
 more effective to link arbitrary game attributes in some manner, such as
 linking dice rolling mechanics to luck-based gameplay (in the luck vs.
 skill attribute). The problem is that linking attributes is such a manner is
 rather complex, especially when the only reason we began down this road was
 to add variety to recommendations; a nice feature, but an unnecessary one.</p>

<p> I think this thought shouldn&#8217;t be accepted or rejected so quickly. It will
 require discussion with the team at the next meeting, and potentially further
 exploring this option in the next interview with Ray.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Note:</strong> This post was heavily inspired from the system design that Ryan, Alex, and I <a href="/blog/2012/09/07/meeting-7/">talked about earlier</a>.</p>

<p>Our team has always understood that we would need some contained system that
gives game recommendations based on preferences (i.e. the recommendation
system core), but this is only half the work. There&#8217;s more to do in storing
the data, and providing webpage interfaces for sending queries to the core
and displaying results. While this bare-bones system should be sufficient to
meet our initial requirements, there&#8217;s still more to add to the system, as we
discovered at our meeting. In particular, there&#8217;s a this system doesn&#8217;t
provide a feature that an expert could provide to a user: variety. Many avid
players are interested in trying something new, even if it is further away
from their preferences. We want to provide an option to the user to request
variety in the search.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, variety is a loosely defined preference in a board game query.
The user can select that they want a strategy game or a 4 person game, and we
know exactly what they mean. If the user selects that they want <em>variety</em>,
then suddenly we have a huge problem. This isn&#8217;t some attribute of a game that
we just match. It&#8217;s the desire to get games that <em>don&#8217;t</em> match their selected
attributes, but still will be likely fun by their standards.</p>

<p>The simple solution would be to just not provide this feature. But where&#8217;s the
fun and variety in that?</p>

<p>The other solution we talked through is to allow experts to map similar games.
Rather than attempt to model variety ourselves, we can simply return games
that are similar to the games the user will like, but that the user didn&#8217;t
actually search for with his input. This would involve providing a new
interface to experts on the website so that they can map games to each other.</p>

<p>I drew up some flowcharts on the proposed system. When the system is
finalized, we&#8217;ll have some proper flowcharts:</p>

<p><img src="/images/diagrams/board-ultimatum-flow.jpeg" alt="Overall system chart" /></p>

<p>The overall I/O of the system with the two proposed engines.</p>

<p><img src="/images/diagrams/query-flow.jpeg" alt="Query process" /></p>

<p>The flow of a recommendation query from inception to display.</p>

<p>Essentially, instead of returning games matched by attributes immediately,
some of these results are then passed into the similar games engine and then
the mixture of results are returned to the user. The filtering in the second
chart exists to remove attributes that aren&#8217;t directly relevent to user
preferences for recommendations; that is, they are closer to constraints than
preferences (e.g. number of players, time to play).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Surprise! None of us on the team have developed a recommendation engine
before! This whole experience is entirely new to us. We&#8217;re not following
any guidebook or teacher directions on how to throw this system together.
What this means for us as developers, is that we have to work hard, early on,
to ensure that the design of our engine is sensical and efficient. The system
components and their interactions must be airtight, or else we risk wasting
energy on code that won&#8217;t make the final cut. It&#8217;s essential that the engine
solves a problem that we can identify, and that the system is built from start
to finish to solve this problem.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of a board game recommendation engine? It&#8217;s easy to think,
<em>to recommend board games</em>, and skip over this train of thought. For any board
game enthusiast with a sizeable collection, choosing a game to play is a
challenge. Even with a type of game in mind, with known time constraints and
number of players, the person will still often be unsure of what his set of
options are. Add into this mix the preferences of several other potential
players, and suddenly the group&#8217;s eagerness to jump into a game is pacified by
the difficulty of the decision of what to play. It is this very scenario to
which we hope to provide a solution. So what is the purpose of a board game
recommendation engine? In our case, it is to take whatever factors a board
game enthusiast considers when selecting a game to play, quantify them, and
allow the user to send them as input into our recommendation engine. The
output will be a list of board games that match the preferences and
constraints that the user provided as input, in order of expected relevance to
the query.</p>

<p>That begets the question of what preferences and constraints the user may
input into the system in order to receive recommendations. That question
alone is hugely significant and difficult, so it will be discussed in a future
post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An additional problem that had the potential to provide an interesting
challenge was that of evaluating the relative reading level of a sample of text.</p>

<h2>1. The Problem</h2>

<p>While many databases exist that rate the reading level on various scales,
whether it is by grade level or on some other numeric scale, there is a lack of
tools to dynamically evaluate the complexity of an arbitary piece of text that
could be sourced from an article, website, book, or many others. An application
could be developed that would allow a user to paste a sample of a text into an
input field, and then return a numeric rating or educational level corresponding
to that text. This way, educators would have a reliable method for determining
whether a piece of writing was appropriate in terms of difficulty for that age
level.</p>

<p>The system would need to take in several criteria as input, such as the level of
difficulty of the vocabulary used and the complexity of the sentence structures
found in the text. These values could then be input into a rule-based system to
determine the final level of that text.</p>

<p>To expand the project, additional machine learning and AI concepts could be
used. Natural Language Processing would be necessary to acurately handle and
evaluate the sentence structure of the text among other issues. Categorization
methods such as clustering could used to compare texts to others with known,
established values, or a machine learning system such as a neural network could
be trained against a large database of texts with known values.</p>

<h2>2. Expert Sources</h2>

<p>As a team we discussed, and even briefly described this project to a few of
our family and friends who are experts in this area, including elementary and
high school teachers, as well as those with degrees in English. Additional
experts who would be necessary to the completion of the project would likely
come from an Ohio State department such as Education or Linguistics.</p>

<h2>3. Our Motivation</h2>

<p>As a group, this project was initially appealing because it provided a flexible
and daunting challenge. The problem has a somewhat subjectively defined
solution, and yet, if it were to work successfully it could provide a very
useful tool for educators. Additionally, it allows a very convenient segue into
other AI areas of interest such as Natural Language Processing and text
categorization.</p>

<h2>4. Details</h2>

<p>Upon researching the project further, it became apparent that a large portion of
what would make this project challenging was finding accurate and reliable
knowledge bases, beyond our experts, to help define the behavior of the system.
It would be necessary to have access to large amounts of texts, possibly by
scraping sites like Google Books in conjunction with an existing database such
as that found at <a href="http://www.arbookfind.com/">AR BookFinder</a>. Additional
challenges arise from the subjectivity of rating a concept like reading level;
our experts would need to provide tangible feedback on the &#8220;correctness&#8221; of a
nebulous concept.</p>
